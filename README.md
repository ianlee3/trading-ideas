# Trading Notebook from Scratch

Some of my early algorithmic trading demonstration using technical indicators, which highlights my ability to optimize trading signals by utilizing technical indicators such as Bollinger Bands and Stochastic Oscillator. My objective is to simulate cumulative returns from the most recent historical data of Ethereum and USD Tether.

## Small project was executed using Jupyter Notebooks, and is comprised of the following steps:

Trading Ideas - My work focused on simulating trading ideas from scratch. Specifically, I performed data analysis and employed technical indicators, including the tuning of the window sizes of technical indicators. I also created a simple order book to execute buy and sell orders using FIFO serving.
I have included the virtualenv requirements for the Python environment to make it easier to replicate my work.

### Summary
The results of this project demonstrate promising outcomes, as both the stochastic oscillator and my trading signal generated capital gains.

## Limitations and Future Work

As an early prototyping the trading idea, the work was treated as a data analysis project mainly worked in jupyter notebooks. the code in this project needs to be cleaned up and reorganized to ensure modularity.

It's important to note that this project does not yet incorporate alpha signals, financial risk management, or portfolio optimization. As such, my future work will focus on developing a comprehensive and wholistic multi-strategy trading system that includes the following design elements:
1. Robust data acquisition and vetting, with supplementary statistics to fill any missing data.
2. System architecture design and version tracking.
3. Backtesting and alpha analysis to optimize the portfolio.
4. Integration with brokerages and order submission capabilities.
5. Portfolio allocation and analysis to better understand performance.

By implementing these steps, I will build a sophisticated trading system that can generate higher returns while managing risk effectively.
